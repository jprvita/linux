 - for cd, bus-width and additional generic mmc parameters
   please refer to mmc.txt within this directory

Examples:
	mmc0: mmc@c1108c20 {
		pinctrl-names = "sdio_b";
		pinctrl-0 = <&mmc0_sd_b_pins>;
		compatible = "amlogic,meson-mmc";
		reg = <0xc1108c20 0x20>;
		interrupts = <0 28 1>;
		clocks = <&clkc CLKID_CLK81>;
	};
